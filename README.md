flaky data structures
---
an exploration into data structures with Mozilla Rust

strong elements of Okasaki's Purely Functional Data Structures should
be here.

I plan to develop binary search trees, a red-black tree, probably a B
tree, and likely a couple others (linear data structures) as the fancy
takes me.

Mozilla rust is slightly unique and interesting in that it provides a
controllable GC as well as a controllable mutability model.


happy hacking.
